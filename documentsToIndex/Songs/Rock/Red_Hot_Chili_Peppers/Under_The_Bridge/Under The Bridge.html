Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
sometimes I feel like my only friend
is the city I live in, the city of angels
lonely as I am, together we cry
I drive on her streets cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills cause she knows who I am
she sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
I never worry, now that is a lie.

Well, I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
take me to the place I love, take me all the way, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
it's hard to believe that I'm all alone
at least I have her love, the city she loves me

lonely as I am, together we cry


Well, I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
take me to the place I love, take me all the way
well, I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
take me to the place I love, take me all the way, yeah, yeah, yeah
oh no, no, no, yeah, yeah
love me, I say, yeah yeah

(under the bridge downtown)
is where I drew some blood
(under the bridge downtown)
I could not get enough
(under the bridge downtown)
forgot about my love
(under the bridge downtown)
I gave my life away
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
oh no no no no, yeah yeah
here I stay
